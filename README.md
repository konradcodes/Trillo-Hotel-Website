# Hotel Review Responsive Website Using Flexbox

In this project I used: HTML5 and focused on implementing BEM methodology for naming classes because it creates more structured css code. I also used advanced CSS techniques such as animations,transitions, mask-image,fill properties and a CSS preprocessor (Sass). I was primarly focused on using Flexbox because it provides me with a very efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container.
